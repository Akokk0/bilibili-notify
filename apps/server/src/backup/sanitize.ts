/**
 * Sanitization core for the backup feature.
 *
 * The sanitized backup must never carry a credential. Rather than enumerate
 * every platform-specific secret field (a denylist that silently rots as new
 * adapter/target platforms land), {@link redactSecretKeys} walks the whole tree
 * and blanks any leaf whose *key name* is a known secret. This is structural:
 * a newly-added `accessToken` under any future shape is caught for free.
 *
 * Blanks to `""` (rather than deleting) so the object keeps its shape — an
 * imported sanitized config still parses; the user just re-enters the blanked
 * credentials. The value, never the key, is what leaks.
